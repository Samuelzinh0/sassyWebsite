              <p>Born in Portugal in my childhood. Lived in England in my youth. Now in America in my adulthood. 
                 Named after a Mulberry tree a common Portuguese last name. Married to a lovely Idahoan. Currently residing in Idaho.
                 Decided to study Computer Science to find out how they tick. Loved every minute of it and now big into creating websites.
                 This is one of my favourite side projects. Didn't really know how much Sass had to offer when it came to making a well built
                 front-end focused website.

            <h3>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</h3>
            <h6>Full-time Volunteer</h6>
            <p>I have learned a lot during this time of my life. Having spoken to tens of thousands of different people 
              really made me appreciate the world in which we live in. All of the different cultures I was in contact with 
              was just astounding. The leadership I have developed from this volunteer job was able to give me a bigger
              grasp of peoples different situations and their struggles. I was able to help people in ways which I have never 
              could imagine as I worked closely with other volunteers. The main purpose of this work was to share the message of 
              this non-profit organisation to others and how the people I came in contact with could change their lives for the better.
              Some times the work needed to be coordinated in emergency situations so I remebered being called to a completely different 
              area to work in to accomodate the said situation.

            <h3>BYU-I</h3>
            <h6>Computer Science Tutor</h6>
            <p>This job really gave me a hard time because I loved it so much I didn't know if I wanted to work in the industry as a programmer 
              or if I wanted to go into teaching programming. Having assited hundreds of students I was able to learn so much from them. Communication 
              was a big improvement as I had to deal with so many people from different places and cultures. I also enjoyed the technical skills that I 
              was able to learn as I had to work though different C++ problems with the students that I was helping. I was able to keep this job for a 
              long time having worked over 500 hours. They were sad to see me go and I was sad to leave but I was able to move on to new challenges. 
              A lot of problem solving came with this job as I was helping a lot of students learn how to debug code in C++.

            <h3>AmeriHealth</h3>
            <h6>Software Engineering Intern</h6>
            <p>A new beginning for me. The world was upside with a pandemic wreaking havoc, but still in this time of despair there is goodness 
              that shines through. As you work hard and work well with others good things can come to you like they came to me. I had been struggling 
              trying to get an internship as I was focusing all of my time on my studies and not putting much effort into finding an internship. 
              Due to working so hard in my classes I was almost graduated doing my Bachelors in Computer Science but still need to meet the requirement 
              of having an internship. As I worked hard in my team in a Web Development class one of the teammates reached out to me almost 3 months 
              later asking me if I needed an internship. I replied yes and here I am at my internship. This is a great company that I work for they try 
              their best to provide their customers with the best services and I really admire them for it. I am enjoying my time here as I work on this 
              huge project and I get challenged daily to solve problems that I have never come across. I am just living the dream.
